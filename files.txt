[Date]

**Dear [Recruiter's Name],**

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Hashir Muzaffar, and I’m a recent graduate from IBA Karachi with a BS in Computer Science. I’m writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer - AI/ML position at DigitalOcean. I’m particularly excited about this opportunity because it perfectly aligns with my passion for AI/ML and my technical experience, which I’m eager to bring to your innovative team.

During my time at university, I was proud to make the Dean's Honour Roll, a recognition of my dedication and hard work. I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, working with Python, Java, and SQL, and I’ve gained hands-on experience with TensorFlow and Git. My journey into AI/ML has been particularly rewarding—I’ve worked extensively with large language models, including fine-tuning and prompt engineering. I’m also familiar with RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) and LangChain, which I believe could be particularly valuable for some of the projects at DigitalOcean.

What really excites me about joining DigitalOcean is the opportunity to work in a dynamic environment that values innovation and collaboration. I’m passionate about using AI/ML to solve real-world problems, and I’m eager to contribute to the development of AI-driven solutions that simplify cloud computing for businesses.

I’m confident that my technical background, along with my enthusiasm for learning and collaboration, would make me a strong fit for your team. I’d love to bring my skills in RAG and LangChain to help tackle the challenges at DigitalOcean.

Thank you for considering my application. I’m looking forward to the possibility of working together and contributing to the exciting work happening at DigitalOcean.

Best regards,  
Hashir Muzaffar
